**Dragons have signed wing Jordan Olowofela on loan from Leicester Tigers for the 2021-22 season.**

The 23-year-old spent the summer on loan from Leicester at Australian team Western Force.

<blockquote>
  "It's a great opportunity for me to develop my game further and I can't wait
  to get started," said Olowofela.
</blockquote>

Dragons boss Dean Ryan thanked Leicester for the loan and described Olowofela as "a different option for us in the back three".

<blockquote>
  "It's a great opportunity for me to develop my game further and I can't wait
  to get started," said the player.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Ryan added: "We were really fortunate that Jordan became available. He was on
  loan at Western Force and when he came back was looking at restricted game
  opportunities.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  "He is very rapid and I know him through the England pathway and sometimes
  that transition from being a young man to being a frontline Premiership player
  can be tough.
</blockquote>

Olowofela will make his first Dragons appearance against his parent club in a pre-season friendly at Welford Road on Saturday (14:00 BST).

**Dragons team:** Jordan Williams; Owen Jenkins, Jared Rosser, Jamie Roberts, Jordan Olowofela; Sam Davies, Dan Babos; Josh Reynolds, Richard Hibbard, Chris Coleman, Joe Davies, Joe Maksymiw, Ben Fry, Taine Basham, Ollie Griffiths.

Replacements: James Benjamin, Aaron Jarvis, Mesake Doge, Ben Carter, Lennon Greggains, Lewis Jones, Evan Lloyd, Jack Dixon, Luke Yendle, Huw Taylor, Ioan Davies, Josh Lewis, Aneurin Owen.
