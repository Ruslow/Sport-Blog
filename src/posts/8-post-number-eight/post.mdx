**After just one season of rugby players at a professional team saw a decline in both blood flow to the brain and cognitive function, a new study claims**

The University of South Wales research followed a professional rugby team over the course of a season, testing players pre-season, mid-season and post season.

It will be published in Wednesday's September edition of the Journal of Experimental Physiology.

Researchers followed a team which plays in the United Rugby Championship.

They say more research is needed on the long-term effects.

Their study, seen exclusively by the BBC, has found that over just one season a team of professional rugby players saw a decline in blood flow to the brain and cognitive function - the ability to reason, remember, formulate ideas and perform mental gymnastics.

The paper also suggests that rather than only concussions, repetitive contacts, or sub concussions, sustained through rugby have caused the declines seen in the players.
