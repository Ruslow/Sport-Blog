**Lionel Messi - described as the greatest footballer of all time - is signing for French team Paris Saint-Germain.**

It comes after the Argentine forward left Spanish club Barcelona earlier this week - the club he has been with for 21 years, since the age of 13.

After Barcelona couldn't afford to renew Messi's contract, he was able to join a different team for free, meaning another club doesn't need to pay Barca any money to sign him.

Signing for PSG, Messi said: "I am impatient to start a new chapter of my career in Paris. The club and its vision are in perfect harmony with my ambitions,

<blockquote>
  "I know how talented the players and staff are here. I am determined to build,
  alongside them, something great for the club and for the fans. I can't wait to
  set foot on the Parc des Princes pitch."
</blockquote>

Meanwhile Neymar, who played with Messi at Barcelona before moving to PSG in 2017, posted on his Instagram saying: "Back together".
