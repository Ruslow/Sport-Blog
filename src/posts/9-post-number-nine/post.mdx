**Lewis Hamilton has welcomed the idea of George Russell being his team-mate should the British rising star move to Mercedes next season.**

Russell is expected to replace Valtteri Bottas at the world champions, while the Finn is tipped for a switch to Alfa Romeo. Neither move is confirmed.

<blockquote>
  Russell is "an incredibly talented driver" and "one of the members of the
  future of the sport", Hamilton said.
</blockquote>

Hamilton also said he expected their relationship would be "quite good".

But Hamilton said Mercedes were better equipped to deal with a rivalry between team-mates than they were when Rosberg was there.

<blockquote>
  "We have learned a lot how we approach things," Hamilton said. "We have made
  lots of mistakes along the way. It is not a concern. "With someone new, it
  takes time. But George has already been on the circuit with us."
</blockquote>

Russell was Mercedes' reserve driver before he made his F1 debut with Williams in 2019 and drove for the team as a one-off stand-in when Hamilton contracted Covid before last year's Sakhir Grand Prix.

Hamilton praised Russell's performances in F1, and singled out his qualifying at last weekend's abandoned Belgian Grand Prix, when he put his Williams second on the grid in the wet, ahead of the world champion.

<blockquote>
  "The only highlight from last week was his qualifying lap - it was amazing,"
  Hamilton said. "He is humble. He has a great approach. Being British I would
  imagine probably helps in terms of communication. "At the moment, naturally I
  have to be super-supportive of the team mate I have right now. So that's why
  I'm always supportive of Valtteri - because we have a job to do right now.
  Neither of us can win the team championship alone. We have to do it
  collectively. "George has already shown incredible driving and I'm sure he's
  going to continue to grow. So where better to do it than in a great team like
  this, or whatever team he goes to?"
