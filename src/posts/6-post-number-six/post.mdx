**Joe Salisbury led the British charge in the US Open men's doubles as he reached the second round alongside Rajeev Ram but compatriot Cameron Norrie is out.**

Fourth seeds Salisbury and American Ram, who won last year's Australian Open, beat South Korean Kwon Soon-woo and India's Divij Sharan 6-3 6-4.

Norrie and German Jan-Lennard Struff lost 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 to Argentine Maximo Gonzalez and Italy's Simone Bolelli.

A number of Britons are in doubles action on Wednesday in New York.

Harriet Dart and Taiwanese partner Chan Hao-ching's match against French pair Alize Cornet and Fiona Ferro in the women's doubles is currently suspended because of rain.

Jonny O'Mara and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi of Pakistan will face Uruguay's Ariel Behar and Ecuadorian Gonzalo Escobar, while Neal Skupski and American partner Jack Sock take on Serbia's Filip Krajinovic and Laslo Dere.
