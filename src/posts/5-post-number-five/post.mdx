**Novak Djokovic began his bid for a calendar Grand Slam by eventually easing through against injured Danish qualifier Holger Rune at the US Open.**

Djokovic won 6-1 6-7 (5-7) 6-2 6-1 as Rune, 18, was hampered by cramp from the third set of his Grand Slam debut.

German fourth seed **Alexander Zverev** started his bid with a straight-set victory against American Sam Querrey.

The 24-year-old - who reached the final in 2020 - wrapped up his routine 6-4 7-5 6-2 win in one hour and 40 minutes.

Zverev is looking to add a first Grand Slam title to the Olympic gold he won in Tokyo at the start of August.

Djokovic's bid to become the first man to win a 'Golden Slam' - all four Grand Slams and the Olympic title in the same year - was ended by Zverev in the Tokyo 2020 semi-finals.

But the world number one is still the heavy favourite to win at Flushing Meadows and become only the sixth player to complete a clean sweep of the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open.

Additionally, it would be the Serb's 21st major title - an outright men's record. It would move him clear of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for the first time.
